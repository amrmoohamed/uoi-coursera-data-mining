A topic model was used on the two subsets, but the report fails to mention what model was used and/or how it was applied to the data set. | The two subsets are comparable. The report clearly explains what topic model was used and how it was applied to the two subsets. | For example, multiple interesting subsets were identified and assessed for their usefulness, or multiple topic models were applied to the two subsets with differences between them analyzed.\n",

    "| **Visualizations: Appropriateness of choice** | The visualization methods are not suitable for the type of data. | The visualization methods are suitable for the type of data, but another way to visualize the data is clearly better. | The visualization methods used are quite suitable for the type of data and made relationships clear. | Furthermore, extra effort was made to make the visualizations beautifully designed and/or usefully interactive."
