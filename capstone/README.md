### Overview

### Dataset

From week 01 activity [Data Set and Toolkit Acquisition](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-mining-project/supplement/Ij7rp/data-set-and-toolkit-acquisition). **Note** the repository ignores the Yelp dataset due to size.

> The natural first step in any data mining task is to acquire the data set. For this capstone course, you will work on a Yelp Data Set that contains reviews of restaurants. You have two options for downloading this data set:
> 
> 1. Download just the [Yelp Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dataminingcapstone/YelpDataset/yelp_dataset.tar.gz) (about 423 MB). Choose this option if you have limited internet bandwidth and do not plan to use the optional toolkits that we supply below. There are also step-by-step instructions for how to unpack the .tar file for [Linux](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-bsd-extract-targz-file/) and [Windows](https://wiki.haskell.org/How_to_unpack_a_tar_file_in_Windows).
> 2. Download a VM VirtualBox Image that contains both the data set and optional toolkits. The detailed instructions for this are given below. Choose this option if you want to take advantage of the optional toolkits that we provide.
> 
> The data set includes information about local businesses in ten different cities across four countries. It includes:
> 
> * Approximately 1.6 million reviews and 500,000 tips from 366,000 users for 61,000 businesses
> * 481,000 business attributes, e.g., hours, parking availability, ambience, etc.
> * A social network of 366,000 users for a total of 2.9 million social edges
> * Aggregated check-ins over time for each of the 61,0000 businesses
